# Session 1: go basics

## Compiler vs interpretable languages

The key differences between compiled and interpreted languages revolve around how they are executed, the tools they use for execution, and their performance characteristics. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

Execution Process

Compiled Languages:

The source code is translated into machine code (binary executable) by a compiler before execution.
The resulting executable runs directly on the hardware.
Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go.

Interpreted Languages:

The source code is executed line-by-line or statement-by-statement by an interpreter at runtime.
No separate executable is created; the interpreter is required to run the code.
Examples: Python, Ruby, JavaScript (in traditional interpretation).

Performance

Compiled Languages:

Faster execution because the machine code is directly executed by the hardware.
Optimized by the compiler during the compilation process.

Interpreted Languages:

Slower execution because the interpreter needs to process each instruction at runtime.
Can have performance improvements using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation (e.g., modern JavaScript engines like V8).

Development Workflow

Compiled Languages:

Require a compilation step before running the program.
Errors are caught at compile time, which can help prevent runtime issues.

Interpreted Languages:

Can be run immediately without a separate compilation step, which can speed up development and debugging.
Errors appear at runtime, which might make debugging slower for larger programs.

Portability

Compiled Languages:

Platform-dependent: The compiled binary works only on the platform it was built for (unless cross-compiled).
The source code needs to be recompiled for different platforms.

Interpreted Languages:

Platform-independent: As long as the interpreter is available, the same source code can run on any platform.

Error Detection

Compiled Languages:

Catch syntax and some logical errors during compilation (before running the program).

Interpreted Languages:

Errors are detected during execution, making it less predictable when issues will arise.

Examples of Dual-Behavior Languages

Some languages blur the line:

Java: Compiled to bytecode and then interpreted or JIT-compiled by the JVM.

Python: Interpreted but can be compiled to bytecode (.pyc) for faster startup.

JavaScript: Traditionally interpreted but often JIT-compiled in modern engines.


Why Go is Platform-Independent:

Cross-Compilation Support:

Go's compiler supports cross-compilation out of the box. You can compile code for different platforms and architectures by setting environment variables like GOOS (Operating System) and GOARCH (Architecture).

Static Binaries:

Go often produces statically linked binaries, meaning the binary includes all necessary dependencies (except for OS-level libraries like glibc in some cases).
This makes it easy to run the binary on the target platform without worrying about missing dependencies.

Standard Library:

The Go standard library is designed to be consistent across platforms, ensuring the code behaves the same way regardless of the target environment.

Using Go Modules for Platform-Independent Code

Go Modules help manage dependencies and ensure that cross-platform compatibility is maintained in source code. For example:
